/**
 * The bar at the foot of a screen in edit mode: how many are picked, the two
 * ways to change that wholesale, a two-press Delete, and the one thing the
 * selection is FOR.
 *
 * ALL AND CLEAR LIVE HERE, not in the top bar. Each screen used to carry a
 * ☑/☒ circle up beside the pencil that toggled between select-all and
 * select-none — one control with two meanings, at the far end of the screen
 * from the bar that says what is selected. Sean, 2026-09-16: they are two
 * buttons, in the bar, next to the count they act on. They are drawn a shade
 * smaller than Delete and the action: they change a SELECTION, while the two
 * on the right act on the things selected, and the size says which is which
 * before the words are read.
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT, THREE SCREENS. Recipes ends it with "Add"; the two lists end
 * at Delete and say so with a SPACE — Sean, 2026-09-16: "the buttons will be
 * `N Selected, All, Clear, space, Delete`". The gap is the point. All and
 * Clear change what is picked and sit by the count they act on; Delete acts
 * on the things themselves and is pushed to the far end, where no thumb
 * heading for Clear can reach it.
 *
 * It was Recipes' own inline JSX until 2026-08-22, and copying it across
 * would have been three bars drifting apart from the first change onwards.
 *
 * NOT ChefMind only any more, and this file is CANON as of 2026-09-21:
 * `CoreMind/canon/app/src/components/PickBar.tsx` holds these exact bytes,
 * and this repo is the `exact` row that keeps them honest. Upstream's Notes
 * screen still has no selection to act on, so CalMind carries no twin — but
 * AcctMind does, as a noted `fork`, because its ledger has one palette and
 * no `themed()` and draws its controls at TAP rather than buying the area
 * back with `WebHitSlop`. Same four controls, same order, same two-press
 * Delete; it adds the selection's sum, which is the thing a ledger picks
 * rows FOR and this list has no use for. A change to the BEHAVIOUR here is
 * owed to that copy.
