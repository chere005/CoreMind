# Stage the web export where the desktop shell can actually load it.
#
# THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. The website is exported with a base path —
# `experiments.baseUrl: "/calmind"` in apps/app/app.json — so every asset
# URL in index.html is absolute: `/calmind/_expo/static/js/web/index-*.js`.
# The desktop shell embedded that same export and served it at the ROOT of
# `tauri://localhost/`, where no such prefix exists. The bundle request 404'd,
# Tauri's asset protocol answered with index.html, and the JS parser met a `<`:
#
#   CalMind could not start.
#   SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
#   tauri://localhost/test/calmind/_expo/static/js/web/index-….js:1   (the base path of the day)
#
# So the macOS app had never once rendered, while ./desktop/smoke.sh passed
# every check it had — it built, it carried the right bundle name, it launched,
# it survived six seconds and it quit. All true of a window showing an error.
#
# THE FIX, AND WHY THIS SHAPE. The base path is baked into the JS as well as
# the HTML (three occurrences, used for loading async chunks at runtime), so
# rewriting index.html alone would still break the moment a lazy chunk loaded.
# Rewriting the bundle would mean the desktop runs bytes the web suite never
# tested. Instead the export is staged UNDER the path it was built for, and the
# window opens it there — not one byte differs from what the site serves.
