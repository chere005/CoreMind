/**
 * Every id core can mint has to satisfy the server's own pattern.
 *
 * `app.php` validates record ids against REC_ID_RE and refuses anything else.
 * A client that minted an id outside it would not get an error worth the
 * name: the record would be refused, stay dirty, and live on one device for
 * ever while the app looked fine. That is the same shape as the batch
 * deadlock next door — a protocol rule the client is trusted to keep and
 * nothing checks.
 *
 * The pattern is READ OUT OF app.php rather than copied here, so this cannot
 * quietly agree with a rule the server has stopped enforcing.
 *
 * Written after a sweep for ids that do NOT conform found two — `~${c.id}`
 * and `~${c.sec.id}` in ItemModal — which turned out to be dropdown option
 * ids rather than record ids, the tilde marking a shared destination. No bug,
 * but close enough to the real thing to be worth a guard: the day someone
 * reaches for that convention when minting a RECORD, this fails.
