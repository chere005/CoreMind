/**
 * A backlog bigger than the server's batch limit used to be permanent.
 *
 * `app.php` refuses more than MAX_BATCH changes in one request — a 400,
 * "batch too large" — and the engine sent EVERY dirty record every time. Past
 * the limit that is not a slow sync, it is a deadlock: the same oversized
 * batch goes out, is refused, and goes out again, for ever. The app reports
 * itself offline while the network is perfectly fine, and the work sits on
 * one device.
 *
 * Measured before the fix, 600 dirty records against a transport that mirrors
 * the server's rule: four rounds, four 400s, still pending after every one.
 *
 * Reachable without doing anything unusual — deleting a folder with hundreds
 * of items re-homes them all and normalize marks every one dirty in a single
 * refresh; so does a long spell offline, or a large import.
 *
 * THE CONSTANT IS DUPLICATED ON PURPOSE and this file is what stops it
 * drifting. Core cannot import a PHP constant, and a quietly smaller client
 * limit would work while hiding the day the server's number changed — so the
 * two are the same number and the last test here reads app.php and says so.
