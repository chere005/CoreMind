/**
 * The service worker that lets the installed web app open with no signal.
 *
 * The native apps and the Tauri shell carry their bundle and have always
 * opened offline; the PWA could not, because a phone with no network never
 * gets index.html and so never gets as far as the local-first store it
 * already has. Everything after the first paint already worked offline — this
 * is only about the first paint.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT INVENT A CACHING POLICY. The server already publishes one, in
 * server/public/web.htaccess, and this is that policy expressed a second time
 * for the case where there is no server to ask:
 *
 *   index.html, manifest  no-cache            -> NETWORK FIRST, cache as the
 *                                                offline fallback only
 *   *.js, *.png           immutable, hashed   -> CACHE FIRST, they can never
 *                                                change under their own name
 *
 * The failure this must not cause — a phone running last week's app against
 * this week's API — comes from a cache-FIRST document. Network-first cannot
 * cause it: online, the network always decides, and the cache is only reached
 * when there is nothing to revalidate against, which is exactly when a stale
 * app beats a blank screen.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED:
 *  · anything under api/ — sync is POST, which a worker does not cache in any
 *    case, but being explicit costs nothing and this is the one path where
 *    serving something stale would be a data bug rather than an annoyance;
 *  · cross-origin requests, which are not ours to reason about.
 *
 * THE REAL RISK IS STICKINESS, not staleness: a broken worker persists in the
 * browser and can make the site unloadable — worse than the problem it fixes.
 * Two things guard that. `sw.js` is served no-cache (web.htaccess), so a new
 * one is always picked up rather than being cached immutable by the *.js rule
 * above it; and tools/sw-kill.js is a worker that deletes every cache and
 * unregisters itself, deployable in one push if this one ever misbehaves.

 * of the one file the app cannot start without. The first offline boot failed
 * exactly that way before this list existed.
