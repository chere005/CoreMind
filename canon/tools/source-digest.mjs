/**
 * What the web export was built FROM, by content.
 *
 * e2e/freshness.ts used to answer "is the export current?" by comparing
 * mtimes, and that is not the same question. Two sessions share this repo, and
 * an ordinary `git` operation in the other one — a pull with autostash, a
 * checkout, a stash pop — rewrites files it is restoring to identical content.
 * Their mtimes move; nothing about the code changes. On 2026-08-12 that made a
 * perfectly current export read as STALE three times in one session, each time
 * naming `packages/core/src/order.ts`, which had no diff against HEAD at all.
 *
 * A gate that cries wolf is on its way to being deleted by whoever it blocks
 * first — deploy-test.sh says as much about hiding a gate's reason. So the
 * question is asked by CONTENT: the export writes down a hash per source file,
 * and freshness compares hashes. A touched file is fresh. A changed one is not,
 * and can be named, which is more use than "the newest file" ever was.
 *
 * Written by tools/patch-web-html.mjs, which is the last step of
 * `npm run export:web`, and read by e2e/freshness.ts.
