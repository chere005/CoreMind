/**
 * The head Expo's web export doesn't give us.
 *
 * `expo export -p web` writes a fixed index.html and offers no documented
 * hook for extra <head> tags on a non-Expo-Router app (checked against the
 * v57 docs), so the export is patched here — idempotently, so running it
 * twice is a no-op and a future Expo that emits these itself won't double up.
 *
 * Why each one, because they only make sense together:
 *
 *  · viewport-fit=cover — WITHOUT this, env(safe-area-inset-*) is 0 on iOS,
 *    which means react-native-safe-area-context reports no inset, the app
 *    never pads for the notch, and iOS draws its OWN opaque status bar over
 *    the top. That bar is light by default: the white strip above a dark app.
 *  · apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style=black-translucent — makes that bar
 *    transparent, so the page's own background shows through the inset. The
 *    app's SafeAreaView already paints the inset with the theme's bg, so the
 *    strip follows the theme rather than any colour hardcoded here.
 *    (Caveat worth knowing: iOS draws the status bar TEXT white under
 *    black-translucent, which reads poorly on the cream Sage theme. iOS gives
 *    no "match my background, pick your own text colour" option.)
 *  · apple-mobile-web-app-capable / mobile-web-app-capable — standalone, so
 *    the home-screen launch has no browser chrome.
 *  · theme-color — the launch value only; theme.ts rewrites it on every theme
 *    switch, exactly as the suite's theme_bg() does.
 *
 * iOS caches an installed web app's head aggressively: an existing home-screen
 * icon keeps the old status-bar style until it is REMOVED and re-added.

/**
 * An uncaught error you can SEE, on a device with no console.
 *
 * A blank dark screen is what a failed render looks like from outside, and
 * that is exactly what an installed home-screen web app gave when the
 * auto-updater was wired in — while every browser and both test engines
 * rendered it perfectly. There is no console on a webclip and no way to
 * attach one from here, so the page has to say what went wrong itself.
 *
 * Inline and FIRST, so it is listening before the bundle runs and survives
 * whatever the bundle does. It draws nothing at all unless something throws,
 * so it costs an ordinary launch a few hundred bytes and nothing else.
 *
 * Listening in the CAPTURE phase, and naming a failed resource separately.
 * A <script> that 404s does not bubble an error to window and carries no
 * message, so the bubble-phase version of this would have watched a blank
 * screen in silence — which is precisely the case worth catching, since a
 * cached page pointing at a bundle that is no longer there looks exactly
 * like a blank screen and nothing else.
 *
 * It stands down the moment the app has RENDERED. The first version stayed
 * armed forever, and iOS fires a scrubbed "Script error. :0" at the page
 * when the share sheet opens over it — so sharing the app's own URL painted
 * "CalMind could not start" over an app that was running fine (seen twice,
 * simulator webclip and Safari, 2026-08-19). A late uncaught error in a
 * rendered app is the app's problem to surface; this screen is only for the
 * boot that never drew anything, which is the one case with no other voice.
 *
 * AND IT RETRACTS. The desktop shell fires one fully scrubbed error on
 * every boot — no message, no file, no line, "error undefined:undefined"
 * on the screen — and whether it lands before or after the first paint is
 * a race the SIZE OF THE ACCOUNT decides: a fresh profile rendered first
 * and the guard held; Sean's real snapshot boots slower, the error won,
 * the screen painted, and the app then finished booting UNDERNEATH it
 * (2026-08-19, his report; both halves reproduced with a diagnostic build
 * writing to localStorage). So after painting, the shout watches root: a
 * render arriving afterwards falsifies "could not start", and the screen
 * takes itself down. A boot that truly never draws keeps it forever, which
 * is the case it exists for.

 * Pin the app to the REAL bottom of the viewport, in a tab and standalone.
 *
 * expo-reset sizes the app with `height: 100%`, which resolves against the
 * initial containing block — and with viewport-fit=cover that block is the
 * LARGE viewport, the size the page would be if Safari's toolbars were gone.
 * In a browser tab with the toolbar showing, the app is therefore laid out
 * taller than the part you can see, so the tab bar (the last child of the
 * root column) lands below the fold and the space above it reads as a gap.
 * Worse, the toolbar collapses as you scroll, so the mismatch CHANGES: a
 * screen whose content overflows ends up with a different gap from a short
 * one. That is the shape of the report — a gap that differs per screen —
 * and it is why this is fixed by construction rather than by measuring.
 *
 * `dvh` is the unit for exactly this: it tracks the viewport as the toolbars
 * come and go. The native app never loads this file at all. Guarded by
 * @supports so a browser without dvh keeps the old behaviour rather than
 * losing its height entirely.
 *
 * STANDALONE IS THE OPPOSITE CASE, and the first version of this got it
 * wrong by assuming "no toolbar, so dvh == lvh == svh and nothing moves".
 * Measured on the iOS 26 simulator, webclip, 874pt screen: dvh answers 812
 * or 820 depending on the launch, svh 812, and only lvh the true 874 —
 * WebKit sizes the small viewport as if Safari's chrome existed in an app
 * that has none, and the app laid out to it sat ~62pt short, the tab bar
 * floating above a dead band. That is Sean's reported bottom gap, finally
 * reproduced. In standalone the LARGE viewport is the screen, so
 * `display-mode: standalone` (verified matching in a webclip) pins the app
 * to lvh there.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT touching padding: the bottom safe-area inset is applied
 * once, by the app's own SafeAreaView, and adding any here would double it.
