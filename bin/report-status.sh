# Report a dtp/tdtp run to the status page at seancheren.com/status.
#
#   sh bin/report-status.sh start  <kind> <target>      -> prints a run id
#   sh bin/report-status.sh beat   <id> <summary>       -> "still running, here"
#   sh bin/report-status.sh finish <id> <status> <severity> <summary>
#
# `kind` is dtp or tdtp, `target` the plan ("core CalMind ChefMind"), `status`
# one of running / ok / failed, `severity` 0 good, 1 deliberate, 2 small issue,
# 3 needs attention. The page colours a run by severity and paints a running
# one purple.
#
# WHY A FILE AND NOT AN ENDPOINT. The status page is a reader; giving it a
# write route would mean an authenticated POST from a shell script, a token to
# keep, and a URL that can change the page. This pushes a JSON file over the
# SAME SSH credentials the site's own deploy uses, into /home/protected — out
# of the web root, so the file is not reachable on its own and the page is its
# only reader.
#
# NOTHING HERE IS ALLOWED TO FAIL A RELEASE. Every failure path warns on
# stderr and exits 0: a dtp that shipped, tagged and pushed must not report
# itself as broken because a status page could not be told about it. That is
# also why `start` prints its id even when the push failed — the caller has a
# `finish` to make, and it should not have to care.
